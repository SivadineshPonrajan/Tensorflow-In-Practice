# Tensorflow-In-Practice

Due to the spread of COVID-19, its a complete lockdown in out city. In this lockdown period, I thought of utilizing this time usefully by learning something new. The main issue was that, most of the online courses are paid and  as a student it was not affordable for me to pay the course fee. Financial aid was an option but it would take at least 2 weeks to process. But deeplearning.ai  provides a one week trial for the 4 courses specialization [Tensorflow in practice specialization]. However, unless or until we work in something we cannot learn much. Thus I challenged myself to complete this course effectively with a handson project on each topics in these courses.

This specialization covered the topics such as

- Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning

- Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow

- Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow

- Sequences, Time Series and Prediction
